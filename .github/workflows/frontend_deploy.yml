# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# Frontend Continuous Deployment (CD) Workflow
#
# Automatically deploys the static frontend assets to the S3 hosting
# bucket whenever changes are pushed to the main branch.
#
# Triggers:
#   - Pushes to `main` affecting frontend files (HTML, JS, CSS, assets)
#   - Manual execution via workflow_dispatch
#
# Deployment details:
#   - Uses GitHub Actions OIDC to assume an AWS IAM role (no static keys)
#   - Syncs static files to the S3 website bucket
#   - Excludes backend, source code, tests, and configuration files
#   - Deletes removed files in S3 to keep deployments in sync
#
# This workflow supports secure, automated frontend delivery and
# separation of frontend and backend deployment concerns.
